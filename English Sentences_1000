There is a village called Rajapur in Banda district near Prayag.
There lived an eminent Brahmin named Amdararam Dubey.
His religious wife name was Hulsi Devi.
Goswami Tulsidas was born probably in the radish constellation on the seventh day of the lunar month of Shravan, 1556, from the fortunate couple.
The baby did not cry as soon as he fell to the ground;  But the word "Ram" came out of Tarki's mouth.
There were 3,722 toothbrushes in Tassie's mouth.
The shape of the thong is similar to that of a five-year-old boy.
Seeing such a strange son, the father was terrified of the evil, and began to speculate about the boy.
Mother Hulsi Devi was very worried.
On the night of the tenth day, he sent the newborn child to his mother-in-law's house with his maid, and the next day he left the world.
The maid's name is Thula Bunyi.
She began to nurture the boy with great affection.
By the time Tulsidas was about five and a half years old, the maid Bunyi had also passed away.
As a result, the boy became an orphan.
He began to walk from one’s door to other.
Seeing this, the mother Parvati was moved with pity for the emerging boy.
She took Brahmin getup and went to him every day and began to feed him with hes own hands.
Meanwhile, under the inspiration of Lord Sharchar, Shri Narayanandark, a beloved disciple of Sri Ananthananda, who lived in Chitrakuta, found the boy.
He went to Ayodhya with him, calling him "Ramj Bola".  There, on the fifth day of the month of May, Shuklapaksha performed the sacrificial rites of the boy.
The boy, Rambola, recited Gayatri Manna without education.
Everyone was shocked to see this.
Narhari Swamiji then recited the Bismarck Panchasana and initiated the Rammantra to Rambola and placed him in Ayodhya to teach lessons.
Rambola, was very intelligent.
Everything that he heard once from the Guru's mouth was memorized by him.
A few days later both teacher and the disciple went from there to the field of pigs.\
There, Narhari Swamiji recited Ramcharit to Rambola .
A few days later, they came to Kashi.
In Kashi, her husband lived near Sesasanatnarki and studied Bedbeding for fifteen years.
While trembling there, the desire to enter the cave dwelling arose in the mind of Tark.
So he returned to his homeland with the permission of the teacher.
But when he got there, he saw that everything in the Tabach family had been destroyed.
So he performed the ritual of reverence for his father Prabhutirdra and remained there and began to listen to the people about Lord Ramardh.
On the 15th of Thursday, Bharadwaj Gotriya, the eldest daughter-in-law of 1543, married Rananthirki, a beautiful girl, to Tarantara.
She began to spend time happily with the newlyweds Pannich of Tarchar
Once upon a time, Tarkchi Panji went to his father's house with his brother.
After Tansva, Tulsidas also went to his father-in-law's house.  Seeing such an attachment of Pattinra, Panni Tangu was very upset;  He said, "If you had half of your attachment to this mortal body of yours, you would not have had any fear if it had been with Lord Shriram;  You can cross the ocean.
Pannikar's words were inspiring to Tulsidas.
He waited for another moment and returned.
Tulsidas went from there to Prayag.
He left his house in Prayag, took up his saintly garb, and made a pilgrimage to Kashi.
Near the Mansarovar, he had a vision of a crow.
While living in Kashi, Tulsidas began to recite the Ramakrishna.
When he was not living there, he used to take the puja water every evening and pour it under a big tree.
That tree has a ghost.
He was saved by worshiping every day.
Satisfied with this, he appeared to Trilasidasu and said, “You have been very kind to me.
Ask me for any wish.
Tulsidas expressed his desire to visit Sri Ramassi.  But the ghost said, "I can't show;  I will show the Hanuman.
Remember, Hanuman is coming to your friend every day.
He will show the Lord if you pray.
